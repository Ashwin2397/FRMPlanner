#Goal
*My main goal for this project is to **LEARN**
*Naturally, if i can make money from this that would be nice
*What would be even better is for this product to be useful
*BUT, my focus is to make a good piece and learn from it
*Focus on finishing it making it function with its basic functionalities
*Design it to the best of your ability, but do not worry about how it might look
*Design can ALWAYS be fixed 
*It **DOES'NT** matter how it looks at the end, you can always improve it if it is within your interest to do so 
***PLEASE** remember the above point or you WILL get lost my freind
